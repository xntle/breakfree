# Breakfree - React Native/Expo App

## Project Structure

- React Native app using Expo
- TypeScript
- React Navigation (Stack & Bottom Tabs)
- NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS)
- Lucide React Native for icons

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React Native best practices
- Use StyleSheet.create for styles
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components

## Design Principles

- Dark theme (black background #000, white text #fff)
- Minimal, clean black and white design
- Mobile-optimized with max-width constraints (max-w-md equivalent: 448px)
- Use Lucide React Native icons
- Consistent spacing and typography

## File Organization

- `(onboard)/` - Onboarding flow screens
- `(start)/` - Initial welcome screens
- `(main)/` - Main app screens with bottom tab navigation
- `(main)/screens/` - Individual screen components
- Shared UI components in `(onboard)/ui.tsx`

## Navigation

- Stack navigator for onboarding and main app transition
- Bottom tab navigator for main app (Home, Focus, Messages, Insights, Me)
- Use React Navigation types (RootNav, etc.)

## State Management

- Context API for onboarding state (OnboardingContext)
- AsyncStorage for persistence
- Local state with useState for component-specific state

## Styling

- Dark theme: #201f1f backgrounds, #ede9e9 text
- Use consistent spacing (8, 12, 16, 20, 24px)
- Border radius: 10-20px for rounded elements

## Icons

- Use Lucide React Native icons
- Import from 'lucide-react-native'
- Icons should be white (#fff) on dark backgrounds
- Size: typically 18-24px

## Best Practices

- read docs: https://docs.expo.dev/
- Always type props and state
- Use React.useMemo for expensive computations
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable UI components
- Handle edge cases and loading states
- Use SafeAreaView for proper spacing on devices
